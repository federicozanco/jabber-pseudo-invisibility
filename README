Jabber Pseudo Invisibility

Description (Brand new method with respect to 0.3.4):
Adds a Pseudo Invisible status to all Jabber/XMPP accounts. When you’re pseudo 
invisible you appear online in some of your buddies's buddy list and offline to
all other. You result online to your buddies in Best Friends group.
This method is completely different from the one used in 0.3.4. Maybe someone 
wants to continue using the old method/version so I’ve kept 0.3.4 in 
http://www.siorarina.net/jabber-pseudo-invisibility/

How it works:
When you change your status to pseudo invisible, the plugin sends a presence 
unavailable to all buddies not in Best Friends group and every time one of them
sends you a presence stanza, the plugin replies with a presence unavailable so
that you result always offline.
It should be something similar to privacy list (just move a buddy to Best 
Friends group in buddy list to make her/him receive your real status) but much
less reliable and much more cheatable.

Hack:
The main issue in this method is that a buddy who want to discover if you're
pseudo invisible (hence online) could just send a presence probe and wait for
a presence in response that will confirm you're not really offline.

Issues:
o - I've found that setting an avatar in Google account and not in Pidgin can 
    be an issue because experimentally I've observed that cyclically Google 
    servers send a presence (I suppose) to update the avatar. This fact reveals
    your status to all your buddies.
    Setting an avatar in Pidgin account settings or delete the avatar in Google
    account settings seems to avoid this issue.
o - When Pidgin starts, if status Pseudo Invisible is set then you appear 
    Online for a moment because the plugin can't avoid "normal" login 
    procedure. You have to result online to the server to get all updates.
    This should be a very short time but quite enough to be catched.

Main differences with respect to 0.3.4:
o - No more polling (this means low traffic and… cleaner code :))
o - Update status of all buddies (not only the ones in Best Friends group)
o - All buddies can start a chat (in 0.3.4 only you could start a chat)
o - Buddies can easily check if you’re pseudo invisible (read Hack)

How to install:
Read the INSTALL file.

How to use:
1)  Compile and Install (read INSTALL) or Download (from 
    http://www.siorarina.net/jabber-pseudo-invisibility/) the plugin for your 
    arch.

2)  Linux: if you don't have GNU make program installed on your system, to 
    install the plugin manually copy jabber-pseudo-invisibility.so in your 
    purple home dir:
    
    (if ~/.purple/plugins/ does not exist: $ mkdir ~/.purple/plugins/ )
    $ cp jabber-pseudo-invisibility.so ~/.purple/plugins/

    Windows: Move jabber-pseudo-invisibility.dll in Pidgin plugins dir (I 
    suppose you can create 
    C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Applications data\.purple\plugins 
    and move the plugin there). In Windows it should be something like 
    C:\Programmi\Pidgin\plugins\

3)  Restart Pidgin and in Tools/Plugins you should see Jabber Pseudo 
    Invisibility Plugin.

    On loading, the plugin creates the group Best Friends (if you can’t see it 
    enable Offline Buddies in Buddies/Show) and add a new status called Pseudo 
    Invisible. 
    Every buddy in Best Friends group will see you online (DnD with status
    message: Pseudo Invisible) while you'll result offline to all others.
    You can move buddies in/out Best Friends group to/not to notify your 
    presence.
    Unfortunately there's no way for the plugin to be notified when you do such
    a change so after moving a buddy in/out Best Friends group in Contact List 
    Menu you've to click on 
    Tools/Jabber Pseudo Invisibility/Update blist to let changes take effect.

    Also note that if you have Inactivity settings enabled you risk to result 
    online (Idle) when the client notify the server. To avoid this, set Disable 
    Idle Reporting and Auto Away in the plugin conf or disable Inactivity 
    settings.

    If have set an avatar in Google account then set an avatar in Pidgin 
    account settings. See Issue.

Old Description (0.3.4):
Adds a Pseudo Invisible status to all Jabber/XMPP accounts. When you’re pseudo 
invisible you result offline (your buddies can’t see you online) and you can 
monitor the status of your favorite buddies (and start conversations). Read 
CAREFULLY the README section below!!!
By enabling “Send presence online to your Best Friends” options in plugin 
configuration, you can allow your best friends to see you online. They’ll see 
your buddy with status dnd (do not disturb) and status message “Pseudo 
Invisible”.

NOTE:

o - although they can see you online they can’t start conversations. Only you 
    can
    
o - if a buddy is in Best Friends group and at the same time in another group, 
    that buddy will not be considered a best friend. This means that best 
    friends have to stay only in one group


How to use:
1)  Compile and Install (read INSTALL) or Download (from 
    http://www.siorarina.net/jabber-pseudo-invisibility/) the plugin for your 
    arch.

    Linux: if you don't have GNU make program installed on your system, to 
    install the plugin manually copy jabber-pseudo-invisibility.so in your 
    purple home dir:
    
    (if ~/.purple/plugins/ does not exist: $ mkdir ~/.purple/plugins/ )
    $ cp jabber-pseudo-invisibility.so ~/.purple/plugins/

    Windows: Move jabber-pseudo-invisibility.dll in Pidgin plugins dir (I 
    suppose you can create 
    C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Applications data\.purple\plugins 
    and move the plugin there). In Windows it should be something like 
    C:\Programmi\Pidgin\plugins\

3)  Restart Pidgin and in Tools/Plugins you should see Jabber Pseudo 
    Invisibility Plugin

    On loading, the plugin creates the group Best Friends (if you can’t see it 
    enable Offline Buddies in Buddies/Show) and add a new status called Pseudo 
    Invisible. Now, to keep a buddy status up to date move it (or copy it) on 
    Best Friends group and then set status Pseudo Invisible. You can add and 
    remove buddies in BestFriends whenever you want because the list in updated 
    on every timeout.

    Configuring plugin you can enable sending online presence to you 
    bestfriends. They’ll see you on line with status dnd (Do Not Disturb) and 
    message status “Pseudo Invisible”, so they know that only you can start a 
    conversation.

    Also note that if you have Inactivity settings enabled you risk to result 
    online (Idle) when the client notify the server. To avoid this, set Disable 
    Idle Reporting and Auto Away in the plugin conf or disable Inactivity 
    settings.

    WARNING!!! This plugin generate a discrete amount of traffic proportional to
    the number of buddies in Best Friends group (it does a polling). So, unless 
    you have an high speed Internet connection (and you think your jabber server
    can support it), it’s not a good idea put all your buddies in Best Friends 
    group!!! You can set the timeout value in Configure plugin. Obviously the 
    lower the value the lower the traffic generated.

Issues:
o - If you enable sending presence to your best friends, they can view you 
    online but they can’t start a conversation. Only you can.
