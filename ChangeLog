Date        Version Note

02/01/2012  0.4.2   Misc changes. I've tried to avoid sending unnecessary
                    presences


02/01/2012  0.4.1   Now every presence stanza sent by the client is triggered
                    and blist updated. This should resolve erroneous Online
                    status when starting Pseudo Invisible


02/01/2012  0.4.0   Brand new method to get Pseudo Invisibility. No 
                    more polling but a weaker and hackable, though cleaner and
                    low-traffic, solution


19/01/2011  0.3.4   Nothing new but I've add a Makefile to make compiling easier
                    and more efficient. Now unused dependencies like gtk are no
                    more needed (Finch users should be happy!)
